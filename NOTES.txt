NextUp  -
done - switch android studio to jellyfish
done - get unit tests to run for common
done - fix url issue - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45253789/unexpected-host-with-okhttp
done -add mock http client (well, mockwebserver)
done - make mockwebserver easier to work with

also - clean out unused dependencies in libs.
add possibility to run scripts at beginning of tests - you have the driver - open up a way to run inserts directly in driver
tackle error handling
go back for a couple not so happy paths.
